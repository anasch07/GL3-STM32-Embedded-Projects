## STM32



Learn how to program STM32 microcontrollers using both direct register access and a library. The TP covers various interrupt mechanisms such as EXTI and SYSTICK, as well as object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques for abstracting the low-level details of the STM32's GPIOs. In addition, the TP includes exercises on direct memory access (DMA) and communication with the STM32's USART and UART peripherals, including both interrupt-based and DMA-based techniques. Overall, these workshops  aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to programming STM32 microcontrollers.



## Installation
1-Begin by installing Keil MDK533. Once the installation is complete, the Pack Manager will automatically launch. Close it without installing anything.
2-Install the "Keil.STM32F1xx_DFP.2.4.0" pack. It will install in the same directory as Keil.
3-Install the ST-LINK Driver (run the file: /ST_LINK_Driver/dpinst_amd64)
4-Copy the ST-LINKIII-KEIL_SWO.dll file to the directory where Keil was installed (by default: C:\Keil_v5\ARM\STLink)
5-Copy the Manips_TP_GL3 folder and open any project
